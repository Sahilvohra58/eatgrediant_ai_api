Analyze this product image and extract the net weight/amount/quantity information visible on the packaging:

1. Net weight with unit (e.g., "500g", "1.5L", "12 fl oz", "300ml", "2.2 lbs")
2. Package count (e.g., "Pack of 6", "12 pieces", "24 count")
3. Serving information if visible (e.g., "10 servings", "serves 4")
4. Volume/capacity for liquids (e.g., "500ml", "1 liter", "16 fl oz")
5. Weight for solids (e.g., "250g", "1 kg", "8 oz")
6. Confidence level (high/medium/low)

Look for weight/quantity information typically found on:
- Front of package (main weight display)
- Bottom of package
- Side panels
- Near barcode area
- On caps/lids for bottles
- Net weight statements
- Nutrition facts panel headers

Return the response in this exact JSON format:
{
    "net_weight": "primary net weight with unit (e.g., '500g', '1.5L')",
    "package_count": "number of items in package if applicable (e.g., 'Pack of 6', '12 pieces')",
    "serving_info": "serving information if visible (e.g., '10 servings', 'serves 4')",
    "weight_unit": "unit of measurement (g, kg, ml, L, oz, lbs, fl oz, etc.)",
    "numerical_value": "numerical value only (e.g., 500, 1.5, 12)",
    "additional_weights": ["any additional weight info found"],
    "confidence": "high/medium/low",
    "error": null
}

If no weight/quantity information is clearly visible or readable, return:
{
    "net_weight": null,
    "package_count": null,
    "serving_info": null,
    "weight_unit": null,
    "numerical_value": null,
    "additional_weights": [],
    "confidence": "low",
    "error": "Unable to identify weight or quantity information from image. Please upload a clearer image showing the product packaging with weight/quantity details."
}

If the image doesn't show a product package or is unclear, return:
{
    "net_weight": null,
    "package_count": null,
    "serving_info": null,
    "weight_unit": null,
    "numerical_value": null,
    "additional_weights": [],
    "confidence": "low",
    "error": "Unable to identify product packaging in image. Please upload an image clearly showing product packaging with weight information."
}

Only return the JSON response, nothing else.
